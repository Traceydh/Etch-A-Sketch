# Etch-A-Sketch
Odin project Etch A Sketch. 
The goal of this project is to develop the browser version of a sketchpad using DOM manipulation skills and everything else I've learned in this course. 

This project was quite challenging in the beginning. After completing it I now have a better understanding of
- how to manipulate the DOM
- how to break up a big project into smaller manageable workloads
- how psuedo code/explaining what I'm trying to do out loud can help highlight points of error
- problem solving skills
- how callback functions operate
- how to update page on Github after editing files

Future improvement to game
- implement color wheel so any color can be chosen 
- implement slider for grid size 
- only draw when clicked
